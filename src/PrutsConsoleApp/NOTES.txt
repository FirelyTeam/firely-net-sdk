PropertyMapping.cs
- added getting of DefiningType e.g. for Resource.id

RoundtripTest.cs
- Added xml->turtle->xml to 

TurtleFhirParser
- Determine resourceType rule is: find triple with predicate rdf:type and a subject that is never the object.


issues
- N.B. Determining memberName is different in XML/JSON and Turtle.
-- XML and JSON have typeinfo appended, where in Turtle "rdf:type" is used.
- datatypes: FhirDateTime
- ComponentComponent?
- when cardinality > 1
- composed attributes like AllergyIntolerance.reaction.subject


TODO:
- Move Program.cs to Hl7.Fhir.Core.Tests and use relative and Tempfolder paths!

-------------
- removed: ElementDefinition / BindingComponent
Renamed
- ResourceReference -> Reference
- FhirString -> String
- FhirDecimal -> Decimal
- FhirDateTime -> DateTime
