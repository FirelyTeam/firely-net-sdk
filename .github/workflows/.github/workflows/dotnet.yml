formatted private key which can be exported from the Cloud Console. The

    # ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this will configure gcloud to
use this project ID by default for commands. Individual commands can still
override the project using the --project flag which takes precedence.

This will make the credentials available to later steps via the
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable. Future steps that
consume Default Application Credentials will automatically detect and use
these credentials.
