## Introduction ##
This is the official support API for working with [HL7 FHIR][fhir-spec] on the Microsoft .NET (dotnet) platform.

This library provides:
* Class models for working with the FHIR data model using POCO's
* Xml and Json parsers and serializers
* A REST client for working with FHIR-compliant servers
* Helper classes to work with the specification metadata, most notably `StructureDefinition` and generation of differentials
* Validation of instances based on profiles
* Evaluation [FhirPath][fhirpath-spec] expressions

The library is currently split up in four parts:
* *Core* (NuGet packages starting with `Hl7.Fhir.<version>`) - contains the FhirClient and parsers
* *Specification* (NuGet packages starting with `Hl7.Fhir.Specification.<version>`) - functionality to work with the specification metadata and validation
* *FhirPath* (NuGet package `Hl7.FhirPath`) - the FhirPath evaluator, used by the Core and Specification assemblies
* *Support* (NuGet package `Hl7.Fhir.Support`) - a library with interfaces, abstractions and utility methods that are used by the other packages

**IMPORTANT**
Before installing one of the NuGet packages (or clone the repo) it is important to understand that HL7 has published several updates of the FHIR specification,
each with breaking changes - so you need to ensure you use the version that is right for you:

* [DSTU1][dstu1-spec] (published September 2014) is mostly obsolete, and the .NET version for this publication is not maintained anymore.
* [DSTU2][dstu2-spec] (published October 2015) in widespread use, and still supported by this library and other tooling on the market.
* [STU3][stu3-spec] (published March 2017) latest release, mature support by this library and most other tooling on the market.
* [R4][r4-spec] (published December 2018), support in alpha by this library. Beta will be released in Q1 2019.


Planned release DSTU2.1 was never published by HL7, but you will still find traces of it, in particular we still keep the NuGet package for it available.
