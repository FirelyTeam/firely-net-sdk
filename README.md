This is the support API for working with the DSTU version of [HL7 FHIR][1] on the Microsoft .NET (dotnet) platform. The API deals with the HTTP and wire format, so you can write code like this to manipulate a patient's data: 

	var client = new FhirClient("http://spark.furore.com/fhir");

	var pat = client.Read<Patient>("Patient/1");
	pat.Resource.Name.Add(HumanName.ForFamily("Kramer")
    	 .WithGiven("Ewout"));

	client.Update<Patient>(pat);

This library provides:
* Class models for working with the FHIR data model using POCO's
* Xml, Json and Turtle parsers and serializers
* A REST client for working with FHIR-compliant servers
* Helper classes to work with the specification metadata, most notably `StructureDefinition` and generation of differentials
DISCLAIMER: The Turtle implementation and specs are still a WIP.
