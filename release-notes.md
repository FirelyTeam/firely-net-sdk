## Intro:
In this release we have a couple of new additions:

- The ```ModelInfo``` class now includes the definitions of all the composite SearchParameters.
- A ```MultiTerminologyService``` to provide a better mechanism for supporting multiple terminology services.
- A ```MimeTypeTerminologyService``` to validate mime-types defined in coded elements.
- Functionality to compare quantities with different units from the UCUM specification using ```FhirPath.Comparable()```.
